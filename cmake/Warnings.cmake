# The language and warning settings of the product targets (notes/modernization-plan.md, section 5;
# issue #8), in one place. The presets windows-x64 (issue #5) and linux-x64-gcc / linux-x64-clang
# (issue #7) apply them to their targets:
#
#	include(cmake/Warnings.cmake)
#	patella_target_language(<target>)   C++23 and the conformance switches
#	patella_target_warnings(<target>)   the warning level, file by file, and warnings as errors
#
# Until M6 (Patella-Modern issue #94) never for the 32-bit oracle's targets, which kept exactly the former
# Patella.vcxproj's flags (/std:c++17 /W3 /Zc:strictStrings- ...); the oracle has left the fork.

# DIRECTORY, not GLOBAL: the variables below are directory-scoped, and a directory that includes the

# The warning baselines, one per compiler: the sources that do not build warning-free at the full
# level yet. They build one level lower (MSVC /W3; GCC and Clang -Wall), still with warnings as
# errors, so the build never stops being green. A file leaves a list when it builds clean at the full
# level, and a list only shrinks; no file is added. A file is on a list when its translation unit
# warns, wherever the warning is (a header included). Paths are relative to the repository root.
# A header on a list (issue #49) is one whose own warnings put its includers on it: its header check
# (cmake/HeaderCheck.cmake), the header alone, builds at the baseline level.

# MSVC: measured with MSVC 14.51 (cl 19.51) for x86 against static MFC (notes/decisions.md, "Compiler
# settings, warnings and code style (issue #8)") and again for x64 (the same 24 files and 1,234
# warnings once the x64 conversions were fixed; "Windows x64 build (issue #5)").
