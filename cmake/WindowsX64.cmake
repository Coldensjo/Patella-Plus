# The client of the preset windows-x64 (issue #5; notes/modernization-plan.md, section 7, M1): today's
# code as a 64-bit Patella.exe with MSVC x64 on SDL3 (issue #127: MFC is gone). Its only graphics engine is the Vulkan
# engine (issue #19; cmake/Vulkan.cmake, notes/vulkan.md) as engine 2: since issue #20 (plan M2) the
# original engines (DirectDraw, Direct3D 9, OpenGL) are not compiled, and ddraw, dxguid, opengl32 and glu32
# are not linked; their sources left the fork with the 32-bit oracle (Patella-Modern issue #94).
#
# - The sources, definitions, import libraries and linker options of the oracle's Patella.exe (the former
#   Patella.vcxproj's, until issue #94), so the program does what that one does: the static CRT, no manifest (a manifest
#   would change the common controls and the DPI handling the user sees).
# - The product settings instead of the original's flags: cmake/Warnings.cmake (C++23, /W4 with the
#   baseline list, /WX) and cmake/Hardening.cmake (/guard:cf, /CETCOMPAT); CMake's default
#   optimisation flags; a PDB in Release and Debug.
# - The resource pictures are extracted from the local Tibia.exe at configure time, as for the oracle.
#
# Configure with MSVC for x64 set up (vcvarsall.bat x64; `python -I tools/build.py windows-x64` does
# it). Without Tibia.exe (PATELLA_TIBIA_EXE) the configure stops; PATELLA_CLIENT=OFF builds only the
# unit tests, for machines without it.
#
# PATELLA_PLACEHOLDER_RESOURCES=ON (issue #127; hosted CI, which has no Tibia.exe and must never get it): the full
# Patella.exe with neutral placeholder pictures (tools/placeholder_resources.py, generated at
# configure time, no CipSoft file read). The option refuses to run where a Tibia.exe is present (the source tree's or
# PATELLA_TIBIA_EXE's), so it can never quietly replace the real pictures in a local build; the picture files then
# go to a folder of their own (res-placeholder), and the client logs a warning at start.
