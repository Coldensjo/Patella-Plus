# patella_core (issue #7; notes/modernization-plan.md, sections 5 and 7, M1): the static library of
# the portable code, built by every product preset (windows-x64, windows-x64-gcc, linux-x64-gcc,
# linux-x64-clang) and tested by tests_core (tests/unit). It starts with the sources that need no
# platform header and grows as files lose their Windows dependencies:
#
#	vlong.cpp, TRSA.cpp   big numbers and the login packet's RSA
#	TXTEA.cpp             the session's XTEA cipher
#	TMyException.cpp      the exception type of PATELLA_ASSERT (compat/assertion.h) and TERROR (common.h)
#	Utils.cpp             the Latin-1 string helpers, outfit colours and packet buffers
#	Skins.cpp             the rectangles of the GUI graphics in Tibia.pic
#	settings/Settings.cpp Patella.ini, the fork's settings file (issues #31, #45, plan D12)
#	settings/PreferenceKeys.cpp  the options of Tibia.cfg as Patella.ini's keys (issue #45)
#	log/LogSettings.cpp   the developer log's keys in Patella.ini (issue #77, plan D16; the log itself,
#	                      log/Log.h, is header only)
#	Extern/regexp         Henry Spencer's regexp (C17, issue #129; types/Regexp.h, TRegexp, owns a compiled one)
#	Container.h           the container templates (header only; their mdspan views, issue #101)
#	AutomapLayer.h        an automap block's layer, 256 x 256 bytes and their mdspan view (header only, issue #101)
#	compat/mdspan.h       std::mdspan, or its stand-in where the library has none (header only, issue #101)
#	types/IndexedVector.h TIndexedVector, the growable vector over std::vector (header only, issue #99)
#	types/Cp1252.h       the client's code page (Windows-1252) to and from UTF-8 and UTF-16 (header only,
#	                      issue #112, plan D4: 8-bit inside, Unicode at the platform boundary)
#	Network.cpp           the connection's buffers, the frames and the XTEA, the servers (TNetwork; issue #110)
#	Communication.cpp     the packets: the senders and the receive handlers (TCommunication; issue #110)
#	Objects.cpp, Map.cpp, Creatures.cpp, Inventory.cpp
#	                      the game state (TMapState's TObjectTypes, TMap, TCreatures and TPlayerState, TInventory;
#	                      issue #110)
#
#	Preferences.cpp, Status.cpp, Talk.cpp, Help.cpp, Script.cpp, sysinc.cpp, graphics.cpp, Client.cpp
#	                      the preferences, the session and the messages, the consoles, the hints, the script and
#	                      binary files, the error texts, the sprite and picture caches, the one TClient (issue #111)
#	GUI.cpp, DialogWindow.cpp, DialogElements.cpp, Dialogs.cpp, ContentWindows.cpp, ContextMenus.cpp,
#	ConsoleWindow.cpp, MapWindow.cpp, MainWindow.cpp, Control.cpp
#	                      the GUI's logic, the windows and the dialogs, and the main loop's control (issue #111)
#
# Since issue #111 (plan M7's exit) the library is everything but the platform layer: SdlFrame.cpp (the SDL3 window
# and event loop, issue #122), Player.cpp (the application), Surface.cpp (the engine selection, which makes the Vulkan engine's surface),
# platform/Win32Platform.cpp, src/vulkan and the test mode's Windows files. Drawing goes through TSurface (platform/
# Surface.h); the library's objects call the platform through platform::Platform(), GetSurface and
# SurfaceExitInstance (Surface.h), and the graphics device choice of vulkan/DeviceSettings.h and DeviceChoice.h
# (Dialogs.cpp's advanced options and Control.cpp's ChangeDevice): what links the library's GUI objects links those.
#
# PATELLA_CORE (common.h) leaves out the Windows headers, so no core source can use them
# (plan section 8). The client (cmake/WindowsX64.cmake) still compiles these sources itself; the library is not
# linked into it yet.
