# SDL3, the platform layer's library. Included by cmake/WindowsX64.cmake and cmake/LinuxX64.cmake: the client's window
# and event loop (src/SdlFrame.cpp) and its input; the clipboard, URLs, message boxes and display modes
# (src/platform/SdlPlatform.cpp; SDL_OpenURL in SdlFrame.cpp); the Vulkan engine's surfaces are
# SDL_Vulkan_CreateSurface's (src/vulkan/WindowSystem.h). patella_core does not use it.
#
#	SDL3::SDL3-static   SDL 3.4.18, built from its release archive with its own CMakeLists as a static library
#	                    with the client's CRT (the static one), only the subsystems the client needs (video and
#	                    events; Vulkan on: SDL_Vulkan_CreateSurface)
#	SDL3::Headers       its headers alone: what compiles against SDL3 without linking the library
#
# Pinned as cmake/Vulkan.cmake pins its libraries: one release, by URL and SHA256 (the digest GitHub publishes for the
# release asset SDL3-3.4.18.tar.gz), fetched at the first configure into build/<preset>/_deps and built there; nothing
# is installed on the system. `find_package` comes first where a distribution has its own SDL3, which is Linux's
# (FetchContent's FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS, 3.4.18 or a newer 3.x); on Windows always the pinned archive. The Linux client
# (cmake/LinuxX64.cmake) builds the pinned archive in the Docker image, which has SDL3's build dependencies
# (docker/linux-x64/Dockerfile: its X11 and Wayland video drivers, no SDL3 package).
