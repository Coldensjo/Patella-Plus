// DeviceSettings.h: the x64 client's graphics device choice (Patella-Modern issue #31; plan 6.3, D12;
// notes/vulkan.md, "Choosing the device").
//
// The advanced graphics options' three buttons choose the Vulkan engine's device: "Automatic", "GPU"
// (the next GPU on every click when there are several) and "CPU" (the shipped CPU driver). The choice is
// Patella.ini's Device (src/settings/Settings.h), next to Tibia.cfg; the environment variable
// PATELLA_VULKAN (the same words: auto, gpu, gpuN, cpu) overrides it at start-up, for the comparisons and
// the tests, and is never written. Surface.cpp (SurfaceInitInstance), Control.cpp (ChangeDevice),
// Dialogs.cpp (TAdvancedGraphicsDialog) and SurfaceVulkan.cpp use it. Windows x64 client only; no Vulkan
// header.
