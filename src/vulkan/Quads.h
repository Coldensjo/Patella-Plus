// Quads.h: the Direct3D 9 quads of the Vulkan engine, as Vulkan vertices (issue #19;
// notes/vulkan.md, "Pixels").
//
// surfaceDX9.cpp, the reference engine (plan D7), draws every copy as a textured quad: integer corners
// on the target, texture coordinates (x + 0.5) / width of its corners, one colour per corner. Direct3D
// 9 puts pixel centres on integer coordinates, Vulkan (and the hardware under a Direct3D 9 driver) at
// + 0.5. ConvertQuad gives the vertices that make Vulkan compute what Direct3D 9 computes at every
// pixel, in two ways:
//
// - A one-colour quad that maps texels one to one (the texture's texel centres on the pixel centres:
//   every unscaled blit) is a copy, marked Nearest: its corners stay on whole pixels (no pixel centre
//   lies on an edge) and its coordinates put the texel edges on the pixel edges, so the engine samples
//   it without filtering and gets the exact texels, whatever a device's filter rounds.
// - Every other quad (a stretch, the light's coloured corners, a coordinate between texels) goes to
//   the hardware as a Direct3D 9 driver gives it: the corners half a pixel on, the attributes as they
//   are. The hardware then covers, interpolates and filters as under Direct3D 9; its filter is the
//   device's, so these pixels are as exact as the device's bilinear filter (notes/vulkan.md, "Pixels").
//
// Portable C++ without Vulkan: tests_render checks it on every preset.
