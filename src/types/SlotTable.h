// SlotTable.h: TSlotTable<T, N>, a table of at most N entries whose numbers stay theirs, an entry with Status 0 being
// free. Not part of the original source. Its one user is Map.cpp's effect table (TSlotTable<TEffect, EFFECTS>).
//
// The original's effect table is an array of EFFECTS entries; an entry's number is its index, which the map points and the
// entries' links hold, and NewEffect takes the first entry with Status 0, or none (-1) when all are taken, which drops the
// new effect. TSlotTable keeps those numbers: its entries are a TStaticVector<T, N> (compat/cxx26.h: std::inplace_vector
// where the library has it) that only grows, by one entry when no entry below its size is free, and is emptied by Clear
// only. So the entries from Size() to N are the ones the original had free and had not taken since its last clear (or the
// start), and New() gives the number the original's search gave. An entry beyond Size() reads as a free one,
// value-initialised (Get). A freed entry keeps its other members until it is taken again, as the original's did.
//
// T: an implicit-lifetime aggregate with an int Status, value-initialised by T{} (TEffect). Key: the entries' numbers,
// int or an enumeration over int (MapPoint.h's TEffectId), its value the number; New() gives Key(-1) when full.
// Chain(First): the entries linked from First by their Next members (a Key, Key(-1) for the last), as a range of
// numbers (a map point's effects). Its step reads the Next of the entry it leaves after the loop's body, so the body
// may free that entry if freeing keeps its Next (Map.cpp's DeleteEffect does).
