// SdlFrame.h: the client's main window and event loop on SDL3 (Patella-Modern issue #122, plan M8; notes/decisions.md,
// "#122: the SDL3 window and its event loop"). Not part of the original source.
//
// The client's main window: the SDL3 counterpart of the original's CMainFrame (the frame window: its creation,
// placement, size, fullscreen switch, activation, closing and destruction) and of CWinApp::Run (the message loop, with
// the main timer in the loop instead of SetTimer). Player.cpp's CPlayerApp runs on it (since issue #127 the only frame:
// the original's handlers stay in tests/golden/mfc for the golden corpus). The window is SDL_CreateWindow's; on Windows its HWND is
// the client's window handle (the Vulkan engine's main window, TGUI's and TNetwork's window; the engine's surfaces are
// SDL_Vulkan_CreateSurface's since #126). Its input (issue #123): the wheel, motion and IME text events, the mouse
// capture (SDL_CaptureMouse), the cursors and the window's coordinates are SDL3's; on Windows the keys, the characters
// and the buttons stay the window's messages, because SDL's events differ from them (notes/decisions.md, "#123").
// Either way platform/KeyInput.h has the client's rules.
//
// No SDL header here: Player.cpp includes it, and the golden tests compile Player.cpp (their stubs stand in for these
// functions, tests/golden/client_stubs.cpp).
