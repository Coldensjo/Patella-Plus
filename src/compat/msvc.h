// msvc.h: the Microsoft C runtime's and compiler's own spellings that the client uses, behind portable
// names (Patella-Modern issue #43; notes/decisions.md, "MSVC-only spellings behind portable functions").
// Not part of the original source.
//
// Each name keeps the semantics of the Microsoft function it stands for, not those of the similar standard or
// POSIX function: MsvcSnprintf is _snprintf (no NUL when the text fills the buffer, -1 when it does not fit),
// not snprintf. On Windows (MSVC, and mingw-w64, whose CRT is Microsoft's) each name is the Microsoft
// function itself (a macro: below, "On Windows"), so the images do not change; elsewhere (Linux, M8) a
// function with the same semantics from the C and POSIX libraries. The pure ones (formatting, comparison,
// copy) are in compat/msvc_portable.h, which this header includes only off Windows and
// tests/unit/core_msvc_test.cpp on every platform, so that the test holds them against the Microsoft
// functions on Windows and against the same expected values everywhere.
//
// Not here, the Windows platform's own spellings, which stay where they are: the Windows API with its
// calling conventions (WINAPI, CALLBACK, APIENTRY on callbacks and imports), the Windows SDK's and the
// CRT's configuration macros (_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS, _WINSOCK_DEPRECATED_NO_WARNINGS, WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN),
// the CRT's file functions behind types/File.h's TFile (fopen as _fsopen, _fileno, the test mode's UTF-16 names
// with _wfopen_s; issue #64) and
// sysinc.cpp's #pragma comment(lib, "winmm.lib") (Windows-only code: timeGetTime, the clipboard).
//
// The descriptor function of <io.h> (_eof) is in compat/msvc_io.h, which only the files that use
// them include, where they included <io.h> before: <io.h> included through common.h makes MSVC x64 emit the
// <charconv> digit table std::_Digit_pairs<char> first among an object's constants, which moves it in the x64
// images (measured, issue #43).
