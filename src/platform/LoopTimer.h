// LoopTimer.h: TLoopTimer, the main frame's timer as a check of the event loop (Patella-Modern issue #122, plan M8;

//
// The MFC frame's 100 ms timer is Windows' SetTimer: a WM_TIMER message, made by the message queue only when it is
// otherwise empty, and at most one at a time (ticks that come due while one waits are not queued: no backlog). The
// SDL3 window's loop asks Due once per pass instead, with the platform's clock (IClock::Milliseconds, a 32-bit
// millisecond count that wraps): true once Interval milliseconds have passed since the last tick (or the start), and
// the next tick is then due Interval after this one was seen, as the next WM_TIMER after a late one. So a loop held
// up for longer than several intervals ticks once, not once per interval.
