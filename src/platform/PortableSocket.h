// PortableSocket.h: TPortableSocket, the platform's network over Winsock or POSIX sockets. Not part of the original
// source. Portable: no platform header.
//
// The ISocket of Patella.exe and of the test build's live runs, where MFC's CAsyncSocket and WSAAsyncGetHostByName
// were (the golden runner keeps those calls: tests/golden/network/MfcSocket.h). One implementation for Windows
// (Winsock 2) and POSIX (Linux), the same code but for the system calls' spellings:
//
// - The connections are non-blocking sockets, IPv6 with IPv4 mapped where the system has IPv6, else IPv4. Nothing
//   posts their events: Poll, the loop's turn (Player.cpp's OnIdle), asks each connection and calls its TSocket's
//   events as WSAAsyncSelect's messages called CAsyncSocket's: OnConnect once when the connect is done (0 or its
//   error), OnReceive while the connection has bytes and the handler takes some (WinSock's FD_READ, posted again after
//   a recv that leaves bytes; MFC's DoCallBack selects first), OnClose once at the peer's end or a reset (FD_CLOSE).
//   A connection closed by an event's handler has no further event (MFC's handle map has it no more).
// - The name lookup is getaddrinfo on a std::jthread (IPv4 and IPv6): the thread writes nothing of the client's; the
//   loop's Poll takes its result, writes the address's text into the client's buffer and gives the request to the
//   Resolved hook (the window's message: the frames' OnHostResolved). A cancelled lookup's thread runs to its end and
//   is dropped at a later Poll.
// - The error codes are WinSock's numbers (platform/Socket.h's socket_error), on POSIX from errno and getaddrinfo's
//   codes.
//
// The client's thread is the only one that calls it; the lookups' threads share only their own result with it.
