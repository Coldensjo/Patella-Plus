// Input.h: IInput, the platform's input outside the window's messages. Not part of the original source. Portable: no
// platform header.
//
// The keys, the buttons and the wheel come to the client as its window's messages (MainFrm.cpp's handlers) or, on the
// SDL3 window, as SDL's events (SdlFrame.cpp). What it reads or starts besides goes through the process's IInput
// (platform/Platform.h): the mouse position, polled (Player.cpp InitInstance and OnIdle, MainFrm.cpp OnSetCursor and
// OnCaptureChanged); the main frame's 100 ms timer (MainFrm.cpp OnCreate, OnDestroy), whose ticks are input to the
// client (ActionNumber's); the idle step before the client reads them (CPlayerApp::OnIdle); and whether a loss of the
// mouse capture is the client's input (MainFrm.cpp OnCaptureChanged); and, on the SDL3 window, whether the desktop's
// keyboard and mouse events are the client's input (the test build drops them with a script, as its message filter
// drops the messages).
//
//	TWin32Input   GetCursorPos, SetTimer, KillTimer (platform/Win32Platform.h); the idle step does nothing and every
//	              capture change and desktop event is input: Patella.exe's and the golden runner's (TSdlLoopInput, the
//	              SDL3 window's: the loop's timer, GetCursorPos)
//	TTestInput    the test mode's (TestModeWin32.cpp): with a script the virtual cursor, the driver's ticks
//	              instead of the timer, the driver's step at each idle call, and the capture changes and the desktop's
//	              events dropped; without one the window path's (the control channel's probe at the idle step)
