// EntryWin32.cpp: the Windows client's entry point (Patella-Modern issue #127, plan M8; notes/decisions.md, "#127").
// Not part of the original source, where MFC's WinMain (AfxWinMain) was the entry and called CPlayerApp's InitInstance
// and Run. Patella.exe and the test build compile it; the golden tests, which have main, do not. What AfxWinMain did
// that the client relies on: the program's critical errors without Windows' own boxes; the command line
// (m_lpCmdLine); InitInstance, and Run unless InitInstance returned FALSE (the exit code is then CWinApp's ExitInstance's:
// 0 after a start refused with one of InitInstance's boxes).
