// Settings.h: Patella.ini, the fork's settings file.
//
// It is the client's only settings file: the options the original kept in Tibia.cfg
// (settings/PreferenceKeys.h) and everything new the fork lets the user set. An existing Tibia.cfg is
// imported once (Preferences.cpp TPreferences::Init) and never written again. The format is plain
// `key=value`, one per line:
//
//	# a comment (so is a line starting with ';')
//	Device=gpu
//
// Keys are compared without regard to ASCII case; spaces and tabs around keys and values are dropped;
// the first line with a key counts. Every other line (comments, blank lines, unknown keys, lines without
// '=') is kept as it is when the file is written again, and so are the file's line ends (CRLF or LF, as
// its first line has them). A parser of our own (no dependency); no platform header.
//
// Keys today: Device (auto, gpu, gpuN, cpu), LogLevel and LogFile (log/LogSettings.h), the options of Tibia.cfg
// (settings/PreferenceKeys.h), DataFolder (ChooseLocations below), ServerAddress, ServerPort and RsaModulus
// (settings/PreferenceKeys.h).
//
// The text: the file is UTF-8, and a value that is the client's text (a hotkey, a name, LogFile) is converted to the
// client's Windows-1252 when read (types/Cp1252.h; '?' for a character it does not have). A file with
// PreferencesVersion=1 has the client's Windows-1252 bytes as they are: it is read as such and converted to UTF-8 as
// a whole at the next save of the options (PreferenceKeys.h).
